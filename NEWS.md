# finalfit 1.0.1

* `ff_relabel()` tightend to allow mismatch between available data and labels. 
* `missing_compare()` code updated to allow arguments to be passed to new `summary_factorlist()`. 
* Quadratic terms (`I(var1^2)` etc.) are now better supported in `finalfit()`. 
* `cluster()`, `frailty()` and `strata()` terms shown in `finalfit()` regression tables as an indicator they have been included in model. 

# finalfit 1.0.0

* First official release. 
* Re-write of major functions to remove older dependencies, improve performance and add functionality. 
* `summary_factorlist()` completely rewritten. New column and row summary functions. Alternative statistical tests included. Finer control over continous variable behaviours. 

# finalfit 0.9.6

* Built on R 3.6.1.
* Better support for multiple imputation. `fit2df()` function for `mipo` objects. See missing data vignette/article for examples.
* Easier now to build on a `finalfit()` table by including `keep_fit_id = TRUE`. See `ff_merge()` documentation for details. 
* Issues with update of `tidyr::spread()` in `summary_factorlist()` so updated to `tidyr::pivot_wider()`.
* `ff_column_totals()` added to be used in combination with `summary_factorlist()`.
* `ff_row_totals()` added to be used in combination with `summary_factorlist()`.
* `ff_percent_only()` added to be used in combination with `summary_factorlist()`. #25
* `ff_remove_p()` can be applied to any condensed finalfit output to reomve the p-value. #26
* `finalfit()` now takes `column = FALSE` to provide row proportions. #26
* `check_recode()` added. 
* `remove_labels()` now works for tibbles. #28
* `summary_factorlist()` includes argument `cont_range = TRUE` to include quartiles Q1 and Q3 when median for continuous variables. #29

# finalfit 0.9.5

* `data(wcgs)` added.
* `summary_factorlist()` geometric sd added. 
* AIC added to lm metrics.
* `ff_label()` now does not add class "labelled".
* Removed capacity for `glmmulti()` and `lmmulti()` to run multiple models from multiple dependent variables. It wasn't used and the list generated was inconvenient for passing output to other functions such as `ggfortify::autoplot()`.
* `ff_permute()` re-written to allow many more options for producing intermediate models. 

# finalfit 0.9.4

* `coxphuni()` and `coxphmulti()` now take the other `library(survival)` functions `survival::strata()` and `survival::cluster()`. 
* Fixed `hr_plot()` axis title edit option. 
* Add option to remove reference level (`remove_ref = TRUE`) to `or_plot()`, `hr_plot()` and `coefficient_plot()`. 
* `summary_factorlist()` digit rounding option added.
* `summary_factorlist()` geometric mean option added. 
* Level label removed for continous variables from `or_plot()`, `hr_plot()` and `coeffient_plot()`. 

# finalfit 0.9.3

* Bug in `or_plot()` and `hr_plot()` introduced in 0.9.2 because of new total column specification. 

# finalfit 0.9.2

* Competing risks time-to-event regression now supported via `cmprsk::crr()`: `crruni()`, `crrmulti()` and `fit2df()`.
* Complex stratified sampling now supported via `library(survey)`: `svyglmuni()`, `svyglmmulti()` provide support for. #13
* `summary_factorlist()` total column now summarises continuous variables.  #17 #21
* `summary_factorlist()` can now take any `Hmisc:::summary.formula` argument, such as `catTest = catTestfisher`. 
*  `catTestfisher()` added. 
* `finalfit_permute()` added. 

# finalfit 0.9.1

* `glmuni()`, `glmmulti()`, `lmuni()`, `lmmulti()` now all take `weights` and any other `glm()` or `lm()` argument. #13
* `summary_factorlist()` rework. Now supports any number of factor levels in dependent. #14 #15
* `summary_factorlist()` now provides total count for continuous variable. #17

# finalfit 0.9.0

* `or_plot()` bug fix
* `ff_remove_ref()` added. #12
* `glmmixed()` and `lmmixed()` now support random gradient models, and all complex `lme4` specifications. 
* Data preparation vignette added.

# finalfit 0.8.9

* `ff_plot()` added
* `coefficient_plot()` added
* `variable_type()` added
* Compatibility for future `shinyfit` started. 
* `ff_relabel()` added.
* Error added to `finalfit()` for not-allowed colons (:) in factor levels. #10

# finalfit 0.8.8

* `ff_glimpse()` re-written to remove `psych` dependency
* `missing_glimpse()` added: single data frame describing all variables and missing values
* `ff_interaction()` added: create variable for an interaction between two factors
* `ff_label()` added: easily add label to variable in dataframe
* `ff_newdata()` modified to take dataframe without requirement for dependent and explanatory arguments
* `summary_factorlist()` modified to allow user to change number of unique factor levels at which a variable a continuous variable is converted to a factor (`cont_cut`). #9 
* `fit2df()` and its internal function `extract_fit` modified to take `confint_type` and `confint_level`.
